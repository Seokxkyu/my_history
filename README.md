## **Overview**
This project `my_history` reads a Parquet file containing a command history, filters commands based on a provided keyword, and sums up the counts of the filtered commands.

## **Implementation**
To run the script, you should provide a specific word as a parameter after the script name `count`.

```
$ count <command>
```
